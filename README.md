# Analysis scripts for RAD-tag and whole genome shotgun sequencing using degraded DNA

### Tin, Economy and Mikheyev, in prep

There are two components to this analysis, each with its own code and readme:

  - [RAD-tag sequencing of ant libraries on the MiSeq](https://github.com/mikheyev/DNA-repair/tree/master/museum%20ants%20test)
  - [Whole genome shotgun of Hawaiian fruitfly sequencig using MiSeq and HiSeq](https://github.com/mikheyev/DNA-repair/tree/master/fruitfly)
    
**Note: these files were designed to be run on the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology SGE-based tombo cluster, and may refer to specific software configurations found there. However, the code can be easily adapted to other environments.
